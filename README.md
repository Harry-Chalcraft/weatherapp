A live weather app with a leaflet map

Go **[here](https://nameless-castle-27658.herokuapp.com/)** for live demo.

This is a simple website developed entirely on NodeJS. We use the ExpressJS framework and ejs templates for the views.
The Sign-In, Sign-Up is set up with a Mongo DB, and the weather information is collected thanks to the openweathermap API for live forecast.

The user's cities are saved on a Mongo DB, and the entire back-end is organised accordingly with MVC.

The map is provided by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and will display a marker on the city entered by the user.

This is a very cool project to develop to get acquainted with APIs and simple DB requests.
